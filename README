				How to Run 

================================================================================
run make
then run ./oss -n -s -b -i -o
-n: number of max child processes in system to ever run
-s: number of child processes allowed in system at one time
-b: number to test primality of
-i: number to increment by
-o: filename for primality output/child launch & end time
if an error occurs you will have to use ipcs | grep {user id}

				Issues

================================================================================
i tried using WNOHANG in waitpid() and ended up spawning too many children
and created zombie processes. i had to set to zero in waitpid() but clock
only increments one second for every process and child terminates immediately
